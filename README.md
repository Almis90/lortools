## Overview

The app is designed to give Legends of Runeterra players a competitive advantage by predicting opponents' decks. By selecting the cards your opponent has already played, the app analyzes current meta decks to provide you with an informed prediction of what the rest of their deck could be.

## Features

- **Champion, Region, and Card Selection:** Refine your predictions by choosing your setup, helping to narrow down the possible decks your opponent could be using.
